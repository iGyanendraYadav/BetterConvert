# BetterConvert : Convert Your Text in Different Case

Hi There, I have designed a text converter. You can input your text in textarea and click on the desired button to change text in desired case like Sentence case, lower case, UPPER CASE, Capitalize Case, Reverse Text etc.
<br>
You need to write some text in text area then only you can see the buttons enabled.
<br>
Please, have a look once!

And you can see live counting of characters, words and expected read time.
